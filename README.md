# Bankist-app---HTML-CSS-JS
 This is a simulator of a bank app, where we use arrays to have different users with their own passwords. The transactions they have can interact with each other by doing deposits and making loan requests. Finally, this app has a counter that checks the activity of the user, if it detects no activity in the time time frame, the app closes automatically
